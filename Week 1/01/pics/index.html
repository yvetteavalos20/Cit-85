<h1>I LOVE DOLPHINS</h1>
<p>I think dolphins are amazing animals in the world. From what i have read on the internet, they are one of the smartest creatures in the world. Dolphins love to eat fish, squids, and crustaceans. It is really hard to estimate how many dolphins there because there are many different species spanning a large geographical area.</p>
